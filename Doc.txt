/// add ///


Pop two values of the stack and push the addition of those two values.


Exceptions : -values aren't of the same type

	     -Empty stack or only one element

/// div ///

Pop two values of the stack and push the division of those two values.


Exceptions : -values aren't of the same type

	     -Empty stack or only one element

///////////



/// dup ///

Duplicate the first element of the stack.


Exceptions : -Empty stack

//////////



/// ellipseto ///

Pop three elements of the stack and draw an ellipse between currentcursor and an other point define by the popped elements.

The first and second popped elements are x and y coordinates of the other point.
The third is the color.


Exceptions : - x or y aren't Int32 values

             - The color doesn't exist


Example : The following code draw a red ellipse between the initial cursor(0,0) and (100,200).

	void main()
	{
		ldc.i4 Color.Red
		ldc.i4 200
		ldc.i4 100
		ellipseto()
	}

//////////




/// :label ///

The label transfer program control directly to a given statement, the statement must be labeled.


Example : The following code is an infinite loop with a label and a br.

	void main()
	{
		:lab

		br lab
	}

//////////



ldarg




/// ldc ///

Push an int on the stack. ldc must have an option.


options : - .i2  :  push an int16

	  - .i4  :  push an int32
  
	  - .i8  :  push an int64


Exceptions : - The push value isn't an int.


Example : The following code push 15 as an int32 and 20 as an int64 on the stack.

	void main()
	{
		ldc.i4 15
		ldc.i8 20
	}
	     
//////////





ldloc




/// lineto ///

Pop three elements of the stack and draw a line between currentcursor and an other point define by the popped elements.

The first and second popped elements are x and y coordinates of the other point.
The third is the color.


Exceptions : - x or y aren't Int32 values

             - The color doesn't exist


Example : The following code draw a red line between the initial cursor(0,0) and (100,200).

	void main()
	{
		ldc.i4 Color.Red
		ldc.i4 200
		ldc.i4 100
		lineto()
	}

//////////



/// moveto ///

Pop two elements of the stack and set the currentcursor to the popped coordinates.

The first popped element is x coordinate and the second is y.


Exceptions : - x or y aren't Int32 values


Example : The following code set the initial cursor(0,0) to a new position(100,200). This will not draw anything on the graph.

	void main()
	{
		ldc.i4 200
		ldc.i4 100
		moveto()
	}

//////////



/// mul ///

Pop two values of the stack and push the multiplication of those two values.


Exceptions : -values aren't of the same type

	     -Empty stack or only one element

///////////



/// rectangleto ///

Pop three elements of the stack and draw a rectangle from currentcursor to an other point define by the popped elements.

The first and second popped elements are x and y coordinates of the other point.
The third is the color.


Exceptions : - x or y aren't Int32 values

             - The color doesn't exist


Example : The following code draw a red rectangle from the initial cursor(0,0) to (100,200).

	void main()
	{
		ldc.i4 Color.Red
		ldc.i4 200
		ldc.i4 100
		rectangleto()
	}

//////////


/// rem ///

Pop two values of the stack and push the remainder of the division of those two values.


Exceptions : -values aren't of the same type

	     -Empty stack or only one element

///////////




starg
stloc




/// sub ///

Pop two values of the stack and push the subtraction of those two values.


Exceptions : -values aren't of the same type

	     -Empty stack or only one element
